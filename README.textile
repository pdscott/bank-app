h2.  Accounting Transaction Software

This repository houses source code for the NCSU CSC517 Program 1 Ruby Rails Project.  The software can be cloned and run locally in development mode using a standard Ruby Rails installation.  Development mode runs an sqlite3 database so no configuration is needed.

To use the app, one must create an account or use one of the following accounts which were created for testing purposes.  Enabling the accounts on a new installation will require running db:seed.

Alternatively, the production version of the app is located at https://gentle-earth-51673.herokuapp.com/
